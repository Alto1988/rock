# Concept of the game
* The game is played between two players, who alternate turns.
* One of the players chooses to play either rock, paper or scissors.
* The other player then chooses to play either rock, paper or scissors.
* When both players make their choices then the outcome is decided.
* The score is kept track of and the winner is displayed at the end of the game.
* You can display the history of the game thus far by typing "history".


# Wins for the project
I think one of the biggest takeaways from this project is that the game is a very simple one and, even though
the game is simple writing the code for the game is not. Keeping track of the design route you decided to take
is the biggest challenge in this project for me.
